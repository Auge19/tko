# tko.tools


This package provides a set of tools, primarily accessed
with `gulp`.

To get started run

```javascript
$ npm install --save-dev gulp tko.tools
$ echo "require('tko.tools')(require('gulp'))" > gulpfile.js
$ gulp
```

Make sure you have a `package.json` set up before doing anything.  

Running `gulp init` will create some files and settings common to tko packages.
