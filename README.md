Knockout Secure Binding (KSB)
=============================

 [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/brianmhunt/knockout-secure-binding.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brianmhunt/knockout-secure-binding)

Knockout Secure Binding (KSB) adds a binding provider that looks for the
property `data-sbind`. It is a drop-in alternative to `data-bind`, but KSB
does not violate the restrictions imposed by the default *script-src*
[Content Security Policy](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/).

This project exists because Knockout's `data-bind` uses `new Function` to
parse bindings, as discussed in
[knockout/knockout#903](https://github.com/knockout/knockout/issues/903).

Using Knockout Secure Binding is as simple as changing `<div data-bind='text: value'></div>` to `<div data-sbind="text: value"></div>`.


The `data-sbind` language
---

The language used in `data-sbind` is a superset of JSON but a subset of Javascript. Let's call it the *sbind* language, for convenience.

The sbind language is closer to JSON than Javascript, so it's easier to describe its differences by comparing it to JSON. The sbind language differs from JSON in that:

1. sbind understands the `undefined` keyword
2. sbind looks up variables on `$data` or `$context` (in that order)
3. a variable may be executed as a function, but it does not accept arguments
4. strings in sbind may use single quotes


**Examples**

Here are some examples of valid values for `data-sbind`:

- `text: value` -- variable lookup
- `text: "string"` -- JSON value
- `text: { object: "string" }` -- JSON object with constants
- `foreach: [1, 2.1, true, false, null, undefined]` -- JSON array with
    constants
- `text: value()` -- variable lookup and execution
- `text: $data.value()` -- execute nested variables
- `text: $context.obj().value()` -- execute nested accessors
- `text: $element.id` -- look up on the special `$element`

The `data-sbind` binding provider uses Knockout's built-in bindings, so
`text`, `foreach`, and all the others should work as expected.


Security implications
---

One cannot use the default `data-bind` provided by Knockout when a
Content Security Policy prohibits unsafe evaluations (`eval`,
`new Function`, `setTimeout(string)`, `setInterval(string)`).

Prohibiting unsafe evaluations with a Content Security Policy substantially reduces the risk
of a cross-site scripting attack. See for example [Preventing XSS with Content Security Policy](http://benvinegar.github.io/csp-talk-2013/).

By using `data-sbind` in place of `data-bind` one can continue use
Knockout in an environment with a Content Security Policy.

Independent of a Content Security Policy, KSB prevents the execution of arbitrary code in a Knockout binding. A malicious script such as
`text: $.getScript('a.bad.bad.thing')` could be executed in Knockout on a DOM element that is having bindings applied. However this script
will not execute in KSB because:

1. The `$` is a global, and unless explicitly added to the binding context it will not be accessible;
2. Functions in KSB do not accept arguments.

The `data-sbind` differs from `data-bind` as follows:

|           | `data-bind` | `data-sbind`
| --- | --- | ---
| Language  | Executes Javascript  | Parsed JSON-like language
| Globals | Accessible | Must be added to the [Knockout binding context](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/binding-context.html)
| Functions  | Accepts arbitrary arguments | Arguments are prohibited


Usage
---

Custom Knockout binding providers follow the same general rules of
application as [knockout-
classBindingProvider](https://github.com/rniemeyer/knockout-
classBindingProvider).

So this works:

```
ko.bindingProvider.instance = new ko.secureBindingsProvider(bindings, options);
```

Keep in mind that if you are using an AMD loader, then KSB is exported
(have a look at the example in [knockout-
classBindingProvider](https://github.com/rniemeyer/knockout-
classBindingProvider)).

**Options**

The `ko.secureBindingsProvider` constructor accepts the options:

- `attribute` â€“ the DOM attribute for the binding, defaults
    to `data-sbind`
- `globals` - Globals accessible in the attributes
- `bindings` - The bindings to use, defaults to `ko.bindingHandlers`

For example, `ko.secureBindingsProvider({ globals: { "$": jQuery }})`.

Tests
---

You can run a standalone server with `npm test`. It will
print the URL for the server to the console. You can connect
to it with any browser and the tests will be executed.

Automated tests with `chromedriver` can be initiated with
`npm start`.
You will need to independently start `chromedriver` with
`chromedriver --url-base=/wd/hub --port=4445`.


Roadmap
---

In the future our bindings may be expanded to include, for example:

- Nested values in objects: `text: { x: value(), y: $element.id }`
- Array numerical lookups: `text: value[0]`
- Array string lookups: `text: value['x']`
- Array variable lookups: `text: value[$index()]`
- Compound array values: `text: value[0].abc`
- Simple expressions: `text: x + y`
- Simple comparisons: `css: { "xy": $index() < 4 }`


Requires
---

Knockout 2.0+

KSB may use some ES5isms such as `Array.forEach`. In future we may
use `defineProperty` or others.
