# Test Platforms
# --------------
#
# This file contains a list of platforms that are tested by the CI
# server.
#
# See:
# https://www.browserstack.com/automate/node#setting-os-and-browser
#
# platforms TODO:
#  - Safari/Windows
#  - Safari/OS X
#  - IE
#  - Opera
#  - Old Windows
#  - Linux
#  - Mobile.
#
# "opera:20.0/windows:8.1"
# "opera:21.0/windows:8.1",
# "opera:22.0/windows:8.1",
# "opera:23.0/windows:8.1",
#
# Note we start Chrome at 15 and Firefox at 11 because that is where
# CustomEvent support starts. We only use CustomEvent in the testing, so it
# is possible that older versions could be supported by KSB or shimmed with e.g.
# https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4#dom4.
